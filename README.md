## Contribution guide

**master** is the latest stable release branch. Basically the branch on which the server is currently running.

**develop** is the latest testing branch, every feature that should be in the next version should go through develop first, then be merged with **master**.

All hotfixes go directly to master branch.

Take a look at current issues, search if there's any with "good first issue", and try to solve it. Don't be afraid to ask questions in the community.

Fork the repo, make changes, make a pull request.
